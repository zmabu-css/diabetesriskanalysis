# Diabetes Risk Analysis

This project aims to analyze diabetes risk factors using statistical methods and data visualization. It focuses on identifying how age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels contribute to diabetes risk.

## Project Overview

Using the provided dataset, we performed a detailed analysis to understand which factors are most influential in predicting diabetes. The accompanying Tableau dashboard provides visual insights into how these risk factors are distributed across different demographic groups.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following key features:
- **Age Group**: Categorical age brackets.
- **Blood Pressure Risk**: Risk categorized into normal, prehypertension, and stages of hypertension.
- **BMI Group**: Weight classification from underweight to obese.
- **Diabetic Risk**: Risk level (low, moderate, high).
- **Glucose Risk**: From hypoglycemia to diabetes.
- **Outcome**: Diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Key Analysis & Findings

### 1. Statistical Summary:
- The **median age** of the sample is 29, with an average BMI of 32, indicating a high proportion of individuals falling into the overweight/obesity categories.
- Glucose levels and blood pressure tend to skew toward the higher side, particularly among older individuals.

### 2. Risk Factors:
- **BMI**: Obesity is a strong predictor, with nearly 50% of individuals in **Obesity Class II and III** developing diabetes.
- **Blood Pressure**: As blood pressure increases, so does the risk of diabetes. The **hypertension stage 2** group has a notably higher risk of diabetes.
- **Glucose Levels**: Those classified as diabetic based on glucose readings show the highest correlation with diabetes.

### 3. Visual Insights:
- The **Age vs. Diabetes Prevalence** bar chart highlights that people aged 50-59 have the highest percentage of diabetes (~40%).
- **BMI Risk** and **Glucose Risk** graphs indicate that individuals with higher BMIs and glucose levels are at greater risk.
- Blood pressure analysis shows that individuals in the hypertensive categories (particularly **Stage 2**) have a significant risk of developing diabetes.

## User Story

A **29-year-old individual** with a **BMI of 32**, my risk profile suggests they fall into the moderate-risk category. The median data shows that individuals like them who are classified as **obese** and have **normal blood pressure** should focus on monitoring their glucose levels and BMI to reduce their risk of diabetes in the future.

The analysis highlights that the majority of people in that age group (21-29) are still at lower risk (~10.86%), but if BMI increases, the risk rises sharply. It's important to maintain a healthy BMI, manage blood pressure, and monitor glucose to mitigate long-term risks.

## Tableau Visualization

The dashboard includes:
- **Age vs. Diabetes Prevalence**: A bar chart showcasing the percentage of people with diabetes by age group.
- **Risk Classifications (BMI, Blood Pressure, Glucose)**: Bar charts visualizing how risk factors correlate with diabetes outcomes.
- **Diabetic Risk Distribution**: A donut chart showing the breakdown of risk levels (low, moderate, high) by age group.

## Conclusion

This project provides actionable insights into how different health factors contribute to diabetes risk. By identifying key risk indicators (age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose), we can better understand how to prevent diabetes or manage risk more effectively.
